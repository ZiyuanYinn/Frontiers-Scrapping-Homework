TRAC Immigration Court Representation Scraping Project
What you chose to scrape and why

I scraped the TRAC website on immigration court proceedings. I was interested in looking at the attorney representation rate for children. This website provides data on the representation rate and raw numbers in immigrant court from 1998. It could be useful to track how children's repersentation rate changes over the years, and how has the current administration's defund in NGO programs change the repersentation rate.

What stories you might be able to tell with the data you collect

(ie - what is your initial hypothesis around why this data may be of journalistic value)

My initial hypothesis is that since the Trump administration canceled a $200 million per year federal contract that funded legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children in March, the representation rate for children has since declined.

What kind of scraping did you use (Regular HTTP Requests, Browser Automation, or Undocumented API) and why?

I used undocumented API, because the data from this website comes from the government database, and the undocumented API helps me to get that data.

What is a subset of the data you can collect or an exploratory experiment you can do to quickly get a sense of whether or not there might be a story here?

I collected the representation rate for children between 12-17 from 1988 to 2025. The representation rate fluctuates, but since june 2020, it has been decreasing. And the representation rate in 2025 has been the lowest and continues to drop.
